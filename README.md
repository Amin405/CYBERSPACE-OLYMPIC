Blue Thrower is a 2D pixel game developed in Unity. The game's objective is to throw a blue character using the left mouse button and aim to reach the target. However, other characters are stationed between the blue character and the target.

The game consists of multiple levels, each with a different layout and increasing difficulty. In each level, the player has to navigate the blue character through a maze of obstacles and reach the target. The other characters, positioned strategically at different points, will try to intercept the blue character.

To throw the blue character, the player has to click and hold the left mouse button to set the angle and power of the throw. The longer the button is held, the more power the throw will have. The player has to release the button at the right moment to ensure the blue character travels in the desired direction and avoids the other characters.
